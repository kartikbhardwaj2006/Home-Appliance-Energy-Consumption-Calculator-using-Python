‚ö° Energy Consumption Calculator (Python)
This is a simple Python program that calculates the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly energy usage of appliances based on their power rating (in watts) and daily usage hours. It also gives tips on whether the appliance is energy-efficient or not.

üìú How It Works
The program asks you to enter details for 5 appliances. For each appliance, you provide:

Appliance name

Power rating in watts

Daily usage hours

It then calculates:

Daily energy usage = (Power in Watts √ó Hours per day) √∑ 1000

Weekly energy usage = Daily √ó 7

Monthly energy usage = Daily √ó 30

Yearly energy usage = Daily √ó 365

If the daily usage is above 5 kWh, the program suggests reducing usage or switching to energy-efficient models.
If it is 5 kWh or below, it praises your efficiency.

def calculate_energy(power_watts, hours_per_day):
    daily_energy = (power_watts * hours_per_day) / 1000
    weekly_energy = daily_energy * 7
    monthly_energy = daily_energy * 30
    yearly_energy = daily_energy * 365
    return daily_energy, weekly_energy, monthly_energy, yearly_energy

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"\n--- Appliance {i} ---")
    appliance = input("Enter the appliance name: ")
    power_watts = float(input("Enter the power rating (in watts): "))
    hours_per_day = float(input("Enter daily usage hours: "))

    daily, weekly, monthly, yearly = calculate_energy(power_watts, hours_per_day)

    print(f"\nEnergy Consumption for {appliance}:")
    print(f"Daily: {daily:.2f} kWh")
    print(f"Weekly: {weekly:.2f} kWh")
    print(f"Monthly: {monthly:.2f} kWh")
    print(f"Yearly: {yearly:.2f} kWh")

    if daily > 5:
        print(" Tip: Consider reducing usage or switching to energy-efficient models.")
    else:
        print(" Tip: Your appliance is energy-efficient. Keep it up!")
